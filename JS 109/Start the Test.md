# Part 1: Start the Test

Make sure that you thoroughly study the topics in the study guide. After you've done so, you may start the test.

#### Time Duration

You will have **3 hours** to complete this assessment. Make sure that you don't start this assessment unless you have that much time set aside. You can still turn in the assessment if you take longer than 3 hours, but you'll get a 10% score deduction for every hour that you're late.

For example, if you turn it in 181 minutes after starting the test, your maximum possible percentage will be 90%.

**Advice**: set two timers, one for the full 3 hours, and one for each problem. Keep in mind that some problems may take longer than others to answer, so allow for that in your per-problem timer.

#### Assessment Rules

Before beginning the assessment, please take a few minutes to review the [Assessment Rules](https://launchschool.com/gists/99b650e4).

#### Passing Score

We'll be using the scoring matrix from the [Assessment Rules](https://launchschool.com/gists/99b650e4).

| Grade | Meaning                        | Percent |
| :---- | :----------------------------- | :------ |
| A+    | aced, perfect score            | 98-100  |
| A     | good, minor errors             | 93-97   |
| A-    | some errors, but ok            | 90-92   |
| B+    | some errors; needs improvement | 88-89   |
| B     | many errors; needs improvement | 83-87   |
| B-    | poor effort; needs improvement | 80-82   |

**A+** and **A** scores are obvious passing scores. **A-** scores may pass, but with some condition attached. Any **B** score is subject for discussion, and we'll likely reach out to you for revisions and input. Scores below a **B** are not passing.

#### Formatting Your Answers

Use Markdown to format your answers, and use the preview feature to ensure it renders correctly. Use backticks to fence off your code from the surrounding text and format it nicely: single backticks formats inline code, while triple backticks format a block of one or more lines.

Copy Code

~~~lsm
```javascript
array.forEach(element => {
  console.log(element.foo);
});
```

This paragraph talks about the `forEach` method being
called by the object referenced by `array` in the above
code. It invokes the callback function for each element,
passing that element to the callback as an argument.
Within the callback, the element is known by the
parameter name `element`, and the callback uses the
`console.log` method log the value of `element.foo`.
~~~

Do not overlook the importance of formatting your answers. Improperly formatted answers can lead to ambiguities which may lead to lost points on your grade. It also makes grading your exam much more difficult. In the most severe cases, **we may not grade unformatted answers.** If you need practice, you should do so before you start the test. This [online markdown editor](https://jbt.github.io/markdown-editor/) is a good place to practice.

#### Start the Test

This assessment is timed. **You have 3 hours to complete it.** It is better to submit an assessment late than not at all, but you will lose points for submitting an assessment late.

When you're ready, click on the link below to start. You will not receive any warnings, countdown, or emails. You must manage time on your own, and we'll take a look at the start and submission times when we are grading it.

When you click the link below, you'll be taken to our testing interface. Make sure to use markdown to properly format your answers, and view your answer once you save it to ensure it renders correctly. Use backticks to ensure code is fenced off and displays nicely. Poorly formatted answers will not be graded.

**Save your answers as you work through them!**

If you experience any problems during the exam, such as:

- accidentally closing your browser, browser window, or browser tab
- power outages
- software failures
- other technical glitches

you can easily recover your saved answers -- just reopen the exam. However, this only works for saved answers. Keep in mind the clock will continue to tick while you're trying to resolve the issues you encountered.

If you experience any technical glitches that may be on our end, please take a screenshot if needed to show the problem, then reload the page in your browser. You can let us know about the problem **after** you submit the exam. (An immediate response via Slack or email is not guaranteed, so you're better off getting back to work as soon as you can.) You can add your note to the Conversation tab.
