# Start a Blog

Throughout this program, you're going to accumulate a lot of random tidbits of knowledge that you'll find yourself Googling over and over. To help you keep track of the things you've learned, you should start a blog or journal. The posts can range from major concepts to minor tips and tricks you come across. Writing about what you learn serves both as a mnemonic device for yourself in the future, as well as a showcase for potential employers or clients. Aside from that, if you keep up the habit, you'll leave a trail of your journey, which, in itself, might one day be a personally interesting artifact.

There are many ways to start a blog, from using a hosted service to rolling your own. An excellent way to get started is with [Medium](https://medium.com/). It's simple and professional, and you can start immediately.
