# Summary

At this point, you should:

- know how to build slightly more complex programs.
- know how to map out logic and flow for a more complex program.
- know how to hold code and application logic in your head.
- know how to isolate code into reasonable "chunks" and extract it to functions.
- know how to write functions that have a single responsibility and are easy to use.
- be intimately familiar with variable scoping rules.
- be able to determine when a function mutates its arguments.
- know how to debug a complex program, using the node debugger.
- feel more comfortable with JavaScript in general.
- feel more comfortable with tearing down a seemingly complex problem.
- search for answers online.
- experiment in the node console or a code editor.

While building the programs, you should have experienced some frustration:

- Small changes in one place can cause ripple effects throughout the program.
- Loading an entire program into your head at once is hard.
- Adding a feature sometimes requires major changes to the entire program.
- A lack of guidelines to organize or break down the program into appropriate chunks.

All this has prepared you for the next step, which is learning about Object Oriented Programming. OOP helps alleviate many of these frustrations, but it introduces additional complexity and some new concepts. Be prepared; it's an entirely different way to think about programming.

Before moving on to OOP though, there's one more quiz for this course. Use this quiz as a way to check your understanding of some of the concepts covered in this lesson.
