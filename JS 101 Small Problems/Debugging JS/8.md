```js
// average omitted

function median(nums) {
  nums.sort(compareNums);

  let median;
  let length = nums.length;
  if (length % 2 === 0) {
    median = average([nums[(length / 2) - 1], nums[length / 2]]);
  } else {
    median = nums[Math.floor(length / 2)];
  }

  return median;
}

function compareNums(num1, num2) {
  if (num1 < num2) {
    return -1;
  } else if (num1 > num2) {
    return 1;
  } else {
    return 0;
  }
}
```

#### Discussion

`Array.prototype.sort()`'s default sort order is according to string Unicode code points, even for numeric values. For example:

```js
let grades = [94, 73, 88, 100, 82, 91, 97, 99, 80, 84];

grades.sort();

console.log(grades);
// [100, 73, 80, 82, 84, 88, 91, 94, 97, 99]
```

This means that some of the arrays in our code were not sorted as we assumed, and as a result, some of the median scores were calculated incorrectly.

The solution is to provide a callback function to `sort()`, and use the callback to dictate the manner in which we want the elements of the array to be sorted.
