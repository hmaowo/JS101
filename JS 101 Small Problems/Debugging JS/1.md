```js
let ladder = ''

['head', 'heal', 'teal', 'tell', 'tall', 'tail'].forEach(word => {
  if (ladder !== '') {
    ladder += '-'
  }

  ladder += word
})

console.log(ladder)  // expect: head-heal-teal-tell-tall-tail
```

**Automatic Semicolon Insertion**

First three lines are parsed as 

```js
let ladder = ''['head', ... ].forEach()
```

Because the statement on line 1 is not explicitly terminated with a semicolon, the array on line 3 is not parsed as an array, but as an accessor on the empty string. Since the empty string does not contain such a property, the result is `undefined`, which causes `forEach` to raise an error.

Bugs like these are the reason why, in the [Stylish JavaScript](https://launchschool.com/books/javascript/read/preparations#stylishjavascript), we recommend that you always use semicolons when appropriate:

> Semicolons should always terminate a statement. With no semicolon to separate them, JavaScript sometimes sees the next statement as part of the former statement, which leads to undesired behavior.

My correction

```js
let ladder = '';

['head', 'heal', 'teal', 'tell', 'tall', 'tail'].forEach(word => {
  if (ladder !== '') {
    ladder += '-';
  }

  ladder += word;
});

console.log(ladder);  // expect: head-heal-teal-tell-tall-tail
```
