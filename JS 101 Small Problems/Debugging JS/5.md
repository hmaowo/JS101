```js
function range(start, end = -1) { // this function is ignored
  let range = [];

  for (let element = start; element <= end; element++) {
    range.push(element);
  }

  return range;
}

function range(end) { // this is a infinite recursive function
  return range(0, end);
}

// Examples

console.log(range(10, 20));
console.log(range(5));
```

Solution

```js
function range(start, end = -1) {
  if (end === -1) {
    end = start; 
    start = 0;
  }

  let range = [];

  for (let element = start; element <= end; element++) {
    range.push(element);
  }

  return range;
}

// Examples

console.log(range(10, 20)); 
console.log(range(5)); // single element should be end 
```

#### Discussion

In our original code, we have defined two `range` functions. One function signature expects two arguments, and one expects only a single argument. But JavaScript does not support [function overloading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_overloading) (the ability to utilize multiple functions of the same name with different signatures). 

- So with the second definition of `range`, the first one is overridden. That is, it is always `range(end)` on lines 11-13 that is executed, no matter how many arguments you provide. 
- So when we call `range(10, 20)` on line 17, the parameter `end` is assigned to `10`, and the second argument, `20`, is ignored.
- The function then executes its body, line 12, calling itself again, this time with two arguments, `0` and `10`.
-  Since our program only recognizes the `range` function on lines 11-13, the function will continue to call itself repeatedly until the stack size is exceeded.
