```js
// rest of the code omitted

function targetRoll(characterValue) {
  let result = roll(d20);

  console.log('--> ' + result);

  switch (result) {
    case 1:
      automaticFail();
      break; // need to add breaks, otherwise it will fall through
    case 20: 
      automaticSuccess();
      break;
    default:
      result >= characterValue ? success() : fail();
  }
}
```

#### Discussion

In `switch` statements, JavaScript executes the statement associated with the first `case` expression that matches. Then, it will continue executing all subsequent statements, until it comes across a `break` statement. Since we did not include any `break` statements in our original code, when the value of `result` is 1, all statements will be executed: `automaticFail()`, `automaticSuccess()`, as well as the `default` statement.

If this sounds only vaguely familiar, review [the Switch Statement section in the JavaScript book](https://launchschool.com/books/javascript/read/flow_control#switchstatement) or the [MDN page on `switch`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/switch).
