original 

```js
function neutralize(sentence) {
  let words = sentence.split(" ");

  words.forEach(word => {
    if (isNegative(word)) {
      const index = words.indexOf(word);
      words.splice(index, 1);
    }
  });
  return words.join(" ");
};

function isNegative(word) {
  return ["dull", "boring", "annoying", "chaotic"].includes(word);
}
 
console.log(
  neutralize("These dull boring cards are part of a chaotic board game.")
);
// Expected: These cards are part of a board game.
// Actual: These boring cards are part of a board game.
```



my solution

```js
function neutralize(sentence) {
  let words = sentence.split(" ");

  for (let count = 0; count < words.length; count++) {
    let word = words[count];
    if (isNegative(word)) {
      const index = words.indexOf(word);
      words.splice(index, 1);
      count -= 1;
    }
  }
  return words.join(" ");
}

function isNegative(word) {
  return ["dull", "boring", "annoying", "chaotic"].includes(word);
}

console.log(
  neutralize("These dull boring cards are part of a chaotic board game.")
);
// Expected: These cards are part of a board game.
// Actual: These boring cards are part of a board game.
```



Solution

```js
function neutralize(sentence) {
  let words = sentence.split(" ");

  return words.filter(word => !isNegative(word)).join(" ");
};

function isNegative(word) {
  return  ["dull", "boring", "annoying", "chaotic"].includes(word);
}

console.log(
  neutralize("These dull boring cards are part of a chaotic board game.")
); // logs These cards are part of a board game.
```

#### Discussion

At index 0, nothing interesting happens. When the iteration is at index 1, the element is `"dull"`. Since it counts as negative, it is deleted from the array. As a consequence, each subsequent word is shifted one position to the left. In particular, the word that was previously at position 2, `"boring"`, is now at position 1. So in the next step, when the iteration is at index 2, it finds `"cards"`. Our mutation of the array caused it to skip `"boring"`.

To fix the bug we have used `Array.prototype.filter()` method. If the callback function returns `true`, the element is added in the new array, otherwise it is not. For that reason, since `isNegative(word)` will return `false` if the word is not negative we use bang prefix `!` to convert that to `true`. Finally, we chain `join(" ")` method and return the final string from the function.

**While iterating over an array, avoid mutating it from within the block. Instead you can use the Array methods [`filter`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter).**
